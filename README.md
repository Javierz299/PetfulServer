Cat and dog lovers, gather 'round! The newest
Now that all the core features of your app are in place, you should have a pretty good idea of how you would explain the app to a user. Do that! Add some copy to your client's dashboard that gives your app a name and explains what its purpose is and how to use it. You could even put this introductory content into its own component on the dashboard to make it easier to show and hide later.

Both repos in this project should have README.md files.

Put all your team members names on the README.md for both client and server
The client's README should reflect the introduction present in your app, and link to the live app.
Include screenshots if you can!
The server's README should explain how other developers would consume (or use) your API, and provide example requests and responses.
Both READMEs should also explain the tech stacks used in the repo, for the benefit of developers who might want to work on your project.
